                Lightweight conveyor belts are designed for applications with
                lower loads and less demanding operating conditions. They are
                typically used in industries such as food processing, packaging,
                and light manufacturing. These belts are characterized by their
                flexibility, smooth surface, and ease of installation.
                Lightweight belts are often made from materials such as PVC,
                polyurethane, or rubber, and they may feature fabric
                reinforcement for added strength. Examples of lightweight belt
                applications include conveying packaged goods, sorting and
                inspection processes, and transporting lightweight materials.

                Heavy-duty conveyor belts are engineered to withstand high
                loads, abrasive materials, and harsh operating environments.
                They are commonly used in industries such as mining,
                construction, and bulk material handling. Heavy-duty belts are
                characterized by their rugged construction, high tensile
                strength, and resistance to impact and wear. These belts may
                feature reinforced fabric layers, steel cords, or specialized
                rubber compounds to enhance durability and longevity. Heavy-duty
                belts are employed in applications such as ore and aggregate
                transport, heavy machinery feeding, and industrial processing
                operations.
